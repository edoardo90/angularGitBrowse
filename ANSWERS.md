> How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent about 6 hours, this because I wanted to finish the task without giving up too much the code quality, for what I was able to.

> What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

- I would add more controls for corner cases, for instance, Http errors, more logs and clearer.

- I would go on with the frontend, I didn't put icons for number of forks and number of stars.

- Maybe some unit tests
 
- I would take care more of responsiveness

I spent even more than I was supposed to, but I enjoyed the challenge


> How would you improve the application's performance?

The bottleneck of this application is given by the backend, because the frontend, basically just displays what the backend sends it.
For this reason, I would focus on the backend.

I haven't tested it, but according to Git API website, using GraphQL it is possible to execute a query tailored to developer's need, in this way time spent for network requests would be consistently reduced because:

 - a single request is done instead of several
 - only the actually needed data are downloaded
