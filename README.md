## demo app for listing user's repo

To run this webapp you will need to open 2 node processes: one to serve frontend page, another to provide backend

### Backend

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Should npm start raise error, just manually launch
```node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server```

Or just ```http-server```  if installed globally   (```npm install --global http-server```)

Then open your favorite browser and head to ```localhost:8080```
May change according to your system, check the console
